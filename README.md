No longer Updated 
  - Unfortunately this repository hasn't been updated in years, in order to use it, several security threats have to be solved. I've outlined below how to solve them

How to update 
  - Update all of the dependencies once they are downloaded using these commands in a bash script
  - npm install -g npm-check-updates
  - ncu -u
  - npm update
  - npm install
